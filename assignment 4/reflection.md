This document reflects on building a website based on the Figma design.

What I did:

Set up a project on GitHub to keep track of my work.
Turned the Figma design into a website using HTML and CSS.
Made sure the website works and looks like the design.
Added some cool features like animations and clicky buttons (where it made sense).
Made the pictures smaller so the website loads faster.
Wrote clean code that's easy to understand (like following a recipe!).
Tested the website on different browsers to make sure it works everywhere.
Challenges:

Making the design perfect on the computer screen can be tricky.
The website might not look good on all phone and tablet sizes (responsive design!).
Adding more features can be complicated.
What I can do better next time:

Make the website adjust to different screen sizes (phones, tablets, etc.).
Add more features that make the website more fun to use.
Make sure everyone can use the website, even people with disabilities.
Overall, building this website was a great learning experience!
